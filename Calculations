Heart Rate Calculation:
Equation: Heart Rate (BPM) = 60 / ΔT
Calculation: Measure the time interval (ΔT) between successive peaks in the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, and then use the equation to compute the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM). For example, if ΔT is 0.8 seconds, the heart rate would be 60 / 0.8 = 75 BPM.

Peak Detection for PPG Signal:
Algorithm: Peak detection algorithms vary but often involve finding local maxima in the PPG waveform. Here's a basic example in Python:
from scipy.signal import find_peaks
peaks, _ = find_peaks(ppg_signal, height=0.5)  # Adjust the "height" parameter as needed.
The peaks array contains the indices of the peaks in the PPG signal.

Data Visualization:
Calculation: Various mathematical operations can be applied to the PPG signal for visualization, such as scaling, interpolation, and smoothing. For instance, to smooth the signal using a moving average filter in Python:
import numpy as np
window_size = 5
smoothed_ppg = np.convolve(ppg_signal, np.ones(window_size) / window_size, mode='same')

Data Transmission Timing:
Calculation: Determine the interval for real-time heart rate data transmission based on the device's requirements. For example, to send data every 15 minutes (in java):
Transmission Interval = 15 minutes

Battery Life Estimation:
Calculation: Estimate the battery life based on the device's power consumption and the battery capacity. The basic formula in java is:
Battery Life (hours) = Battery Capacity (mAh) / Average Power Consumption (mA)
You need to measure or estimate the device's average power consumption over time.

Heart Rate Sensor Sampling Rate:
Calculation: Select the sensor's sampling rate based on the device's requirements. For example, if you want to sample at 100 Hz, your sampling period (Δt) in java is:
Sampling Rate (Hz) = 100 Hz
Δt = 1 / Sampling Rate = 1 / 100 = 0.01 seconds

Threshold for Alarm System:
Calculation: Define threshold values for heart rate patterns that trigger the alarm system. For example, you might set a threshold for high heart rate as (java):
High Heart Rate Threshold = 120 BPM
When the measured heart rate exceeds this value, it triggers the alarm system.
